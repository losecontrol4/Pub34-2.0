Hi! I'm Adam. I just wanted to add info about a current freelance project I'm working on that provides experience with trading. 
I built a backend to communicate with the forex connect api and a front end dashboard to open and close positions and view various stats. 
After providing the dashboard to test everything, I'm now in the process of implementing it all with the client's dashboard.
